# WSC digital

This directory contains design examples for digital design based on verilog and systemverilog
Basically simulation can be done with iverilog, as waveform viewer for simulation results gtkwave can be used.

Note that both, iverilog and gtkwave can be installed within windows on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with simple apt-get install commands.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install iverilog
sudo apt-get install gtkwave

```
